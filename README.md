# Software Security Project

To Start:
- compile both server and client by "cc -o server server.c" / "cc -o client client.c"
- start the server using the compiled result by "sudo ./server". (The setuid() function may not work if start the server without "sudo": e.g. "./server")
- start the client "./client"
- You will see the correct message communication.
